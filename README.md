## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Enter text into the editor and the preview section is updated as they type
- If user enters GitHub flavoured markdown into the editor, the text should render as HTML in the preview section
- When previewer first loads it should already contain default text with certain elements

- I used vanila JS for this as I wanted to brush up a bit on just keeping it simple for a change.
